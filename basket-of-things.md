* Apply even if you don't have all requirements. The criteria describe the ideal candidate. You will need to meet the essential criteria, but if you meet 60-70% it is probably worth applying. Good practice too!

* A preferred skill is not essential, but you are more likely to be short listed if you have it. What you don't know is the skills of your fellow applicants, so it is usually worth applying and talking up the skills, quals and experience you do have.

* Your job as an applicant is to show how you're a good fit for the role and respond effectively to the criteria as well as communicate your enthusiasm for the role and the organisation. This can help alleviate concerns about being over qualified.

* Address all selection criteria that you are able to respond to with evidence of quals, skills and experience.

* How to differentiate yourself? Volunteering, extra-curricular activities, join professional associations, interests (sports, music, etc). Important to show the relevance of your transferable skills to the role you are applying for, you can build these skills in a variety of contexts.

* Ask for salary, they are obligated to provide this beforehand.

* Resume and CV are interchangeable terms in Australia, this is your document outlining your skills, qualifications and experience. https://www.sydney.edu.au/careers/students/applying-for-jobs/how-to-write-a-resume.html

* Your cover letter is a summary of the key information from your resume specifically relating to the role you are applying for, your highlights, introducing you to the employer. It also includes research of the organisation. https://www.sydney.edu.au/careers/students/applying-for-jobs/how-to-write-a-cover-letter.html

* Bullet points are best for resumes, sentences and paragraphs for cover letters.

* You don' t need to include your street address on your resume of cover letter, unless you think it could work in your favour if you live within 30 minutes of the organisation.

* Hyperlinks are fine, such as to LinkedIn.

* Your resume is your marketing document, focus on the skills, quals and experience you DO have, don't apologise for any deficiencies. If you think you can address the majority of the criteria effectively, go ahead and apply.

* It's your job to be succinct in showing how your skills meet the criteria and to be selective in what you include. This will showcase your strong written communication skills.

* If you're lacking referees, try to gain some. You can ask an academic as well as people who have supervised you in work, internship, volunteering and extra-curricular experiences. Ideally paid work experiences if possible.

* 1-3 pages is fine for most industries, some job advertisements will specify maximum 2 pages for the resume, then ensure you follow these instructions.

* If you don't have strong academic achievements, focus on what you DO have. Relevant experience? Volunteering? Extra-curriculars? Do you have high marks for some subjects, even if your overall marks aren't high. You can highlight specific subjects in this case. What are your other achievements?

* Internships belong in the experience section as this relates to the practical application of your knowledge, not education.

* You can avoid age bias by removing dates for education if you want to and only going back 10 years in your experience.

* Volunteering and Extra-curriculars would generally have their own separate headings outside of work experience

* You could list subjects you've done well in under the Education section with the mark next to the subject.

* Reference letters are rarely asked for, prospective employers want to gain answers to specific questions so prefer to be able to contact referees and gain the information they require.

* Don't sell yourself short by only writing a 1 page resume, it will be difficult to show all the skills, quals and experience you have in such a small space.

* Yes, recruiters will consider applications with a lot of volunteering experience, particularly if you can show the relevance.

* Referees will be contacted if you at the end of the recruitment process, there may be 2-3 candidates being considered and the referee feedback will assist with making the decision. If you are applying for a few roles, ie internships, let your referees know that you are applying for some internships and make sure they are still happy to be a referee when you are requested to provide this information. If they are going to be contacted by the recruiter, email your resume, cover letter and the job advert through to your referee so they know what the job will entail and to remind them of your relationship to them.

* If you have 2 roles within 1 organisation, this sounds like you may have progressed to more responsibility? You can list these as separate roles under the heading of 1 employer. This will highlight that you are a good employee as you have secured 2 roles with the same

Generally your cover letter is 1 page long, sometimes you are given up to 2 pages and asked to include detailed paragraphs addressing specific criteria. Read the application instructions clearly to know what is required.

* With the closing statement in the cover letter, if you don't feel comfortable including the word/assumption of interview, you could write, I look forward to discussing this opportunity with you further. This could be as part of a phone screening, etc and doesn't make any assumptions.

* Only include minimal information in your email as this won't be saved, be brief.

* Do keep your experience in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

* No need to include written reference letters with your resume, these can be provided later in the process.

* You could take the initiative to contact the organisation and find out the name of the recruiter for the position you're applying for and then you can personally address your cover letter.

* When an application asks for an industry related example of your prior experiences working for a similar role (even though it is a entry level position) what are they looking for in the response?
